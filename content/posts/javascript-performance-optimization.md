JavaScript performance optimization goes beyond basic best practices. Here are advanced techniques that make a real difference.

## Profiling and Measurement

You can't optimize what you can't measure. Learn to use browser dev tools and profiling techniques effectively.

## Memory Management

Avoid memory leaks by understanding closures, event listeners, and garbage collection patterns.

## Modern JavaScript Features

Use modern features like Web Workers, WebAssembly, and optimized APIs for better performance.

## Bundle Optimization

Tree shaking, code splitting, and lazy loading can dramatically improve your application's performance.

Performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.
