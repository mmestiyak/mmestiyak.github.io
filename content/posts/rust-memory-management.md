Rust's memory management system is revolutionary. Unlike garbage-collected languages, Rust ensures memory safety at compile time.

## Ownership Rules

Every value in Rust has a single owner. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped automatically.

## Borrowing and References

Instead of transferring ownership, you can borrow references to values. The borrow checker ensures these references are valid.

## Lifetimes

Lifetimes specify how long references should be valid, preventing dangling pointers and use-after-free bugs.

This system eliminates entire classes of bugs while maintaining performance comparable to C++.
