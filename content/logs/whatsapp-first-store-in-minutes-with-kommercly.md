I built Kommercly to make launching online instant. Agencies take weeks. DIY tools burn time and money on themes, apps, and invoices. Meanwhile buyers are already asking “price?” on WhatsApp. Kommercly is a no-code WhatsApp store builder that turns your Google Sheet into a live store fast — built for no-code ecommerce and fast online store launches in Bangladesh and beyond.

Copy our Google Sheet template, add your store info and products, paste the link - Kommercly puts a WhatsApp-ready store live in minutes with product names, prices, and images. No code. No developer. 0% fees.

If you can manage a Google Sheet, you can launch in minutes. Free 3-month trial. No card. Nothing to lose.

## Why WhatsApp-First Matters

Your customers already live in WhatsApp. Meeting them there means fewer drop-offs and faster replies. Kommercly is designed for that reality:

- Share your store link, collect orders via WhatsApp, and keep the conversation going.  
- No heavy storefront setup - just clean product pages fed from your Google Sheet.  
- Export clean data when you need to plug into spreadsheets, ERPs, or reports.  
- Receive orders in WhatsApp and auto-log each order to your Google Sheet.  

## Keep Orders In One Place (Google Sheets)

- Orders log to your Google Sheet  
- Track status without new tools  
- No paperwork, no messy DMs  

## What You Get (Without the Bloat)

- **Keep every sale** - 0% platform fee  
- **Go live in minutes** - average setup under 2 minutes  
- **No code** - if you can edit a Google Sheet, you can run the store  
- **Clean defaults** - a template that looks good out of the box  
- **Free 3-month trial (no card)** - perfect for pilots, validation, and vendor onboarding  

## Get Live In 3 Steps
