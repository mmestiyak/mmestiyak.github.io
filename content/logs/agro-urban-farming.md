Urban farming brings agriculture to the city, creating sustainable food systems in unexpected places.

## Container Gardening

Even small balconies can produce fresh herbs and vegetables. Container gardening is perfect for urban spaces.

## Hydroponic Systems

Hydroponics allows year-round growing without soil. Perfect for apartments with limited outdoor space.

## Community Benefits

Urban farms create community connections and provide access to fresh, local produce in food deserts.

Growing your own food connects you to the earth and teaches patience - valuable lessons for any developer.
