Data structures are the building blocks of efficient software. In this post, we'll explore the most important data structures every developer should know.

## Arrays and Lists

Arrays provide constant-time access but require contiguous memory. Lists offer flexibility but with trade-offs in performance.

## Hash Tables

Hash tables offer O(1) average-case performance for lookups, making them ideal for caching and indexing.

## Trees and Graphs

Trees provide hierarchical organization, while graphs model complex relationships between entities.

Understanding these fundamentals will make you a more effective programmer.
